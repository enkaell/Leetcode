# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository. This collection showcases my approaches to various algorithmic challenges, implemented primarily in Go.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on problem categories:

- [array_and_string/](https://github.com/enkaell/Leetcode/tree/main/array_and_string) â€“ Solutions focusing on array and string manipulations.

Each directory contains:

- **Solution Files**: Go files (`.go`) with the implemented solutions.
- **README.md**: A brief description of the problems and solutions within the directory.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/enkaell/Leetcode.git
   cd Leetcode
   ```


2. **Running the Solutions**

Running the Solutions
Ensure you have Go installed on your system. To run a solution:
```
go run main.go
```
Solutions can be called directly as functions from each package
